# Shark_predictAVM
Here is a series of scripts to extract enviromental variables, select depth layers from 4D netCDFs, and fit BRT models

### Scripts available
*1_Preparing_dataframe*: Data organising

*2_Obtaining_Enviro_data*: Enables downloading data from CMEMS (future research - requiered update to Python) and ERA5 (Copernicus) and enables extracting the enviromental data to the surveyed points.

*3_Subsetting_Checking_data*: Conduct pre-fitting checks on data.

*4_Fitting_brt.R*: Enables fitting a brt model applied to predict at-vessel mortality (AVM) for demersal sharks using biological, enviromental and fishing operation drivers.

*4_Plots*: Create study map and raincloud plots as data summary.
