The present database was used to fit the boosted regression trees models presented in this scientific article. 


### This database contains information on:


#### (1) The relative identification of each individual studied, including:

Database code   Full name 								Units

scientificName	Scientific name of the study species 					Scyliorhinus canicula, Galeus melastomus

spCode		Code given to name each species  					Scyliorhinus canicula == Scanicula, Galeus melastomus == Gmelastomus

organismID	identification number given to each specimen 				ranging from 1 to 3079 

towN		identification number given to each tow analysed			ranging from 1 to 66		

vessel		identification number given to each trawler collaborating in the study	ranging from 1 to 8

date		date when the tow occurred						ranging from 02-12-2020 to 15-06-2022

Vessel name and fishing location was omitted as observation campaigns were conducted on board commercial trawlers and such information is confidential.

 


#### (2) Survival stage of the specimen at the time when sharks were released back to sea:

Database code   Full name				Units

mortality	Mortality stage of the specimen		0 == alive,  1 == dead

 



#### (3) Biological, environmental and fishing operation predictors considered into the modelling approach.
